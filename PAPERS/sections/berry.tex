\section{Digression: Berry phase}
The Bloch wave function is not unique: $|u_\kv\rngl\to e^{i\phi(\kv)}|u_\nk\rngl$ is invariant under the gauge transformation $\Av \to \Av +\grad_\kv \phi(\kv)$ where
\blgn
\Av=i\lngl u_\kv|\grad_\kv u_\kv\rngl
\elgn
is known as the \emph{Berry connection} (analogous to the magnetic vector potential). 
For any close loop $\mcC$ in the $\kv$-space, the Berry phase can be defined as
\blgn
\gamma_C=\oint_\mcC \Av.d\kv =\int_\mcS \mcF d^2\kv\,
\elgn 
where $\mcF\equiv \curl A$ is known as the \emph{Berry curvature}.

For a TLS Hamiltonian $H(\kv)=\vec{d}(\kv).\vec{\sig}$, Berry showed~\cite{berry:prs84}\tbs
\blgn
\g_\mcC=\Om/2
\elgn
where $\Om$ is the solid angle swept out by $\h d(\kv)$.
